# MoMo SMS Data Processor

## Team Name

Group-7 -> Enterprise WEb Development

## Project Description

This project is part of our continuous formative assessment for Fullstack Development.  
Our goal is to design and develop an **enterprise-level fullstack application** that:

- Processes **MoMo SMS data** in XML format
- Cleans and categorizes the data
- Stores it in a relational database
- Provides a **frontend interface** to analyze and visualize the data

The project tests our skills in **backend data processing, database management, and frontend development**, while also giving us hands-on practice with **Agile workflows and collaborative development**.

## Project Status

### Week 1 - Completed

- Set up the shared GitHub repository
- Define the system architecture
- Organize tasks

### Week 2 - Database Foundation (Completed)

- Comprehensive database design and ERD creation
- MySQL database implementation with advanced features
- JSON data modeling and API response design
- Security rules and performance optimization
- Sample data and testing queries

## Database Design

Our database design implements a robust relational model optimized for mobile money transaction processing:

### Core Entities

- **Users** - Customer and participant information with KYC tracking
- **Service Providers** - Mobile money providers (MTN, Airtel, Vodafone, etc.)
- **Transaction Categories** - Transaction types with dynamic fee structures
- **User Provider Accounts** - Many-to-many relationship supporting multi-provider accounts
- **Transactions** - Complete transaction records with balance tracking
- **System Logs** - Comprehensive audit trail and error tracking
- **Failed Transactions** - Error analysis and retry management
- **User Sessions** - Web interface security and session management

### Key Design Features

- **Many-to-Many Relationships** - Users can have accounts with multiple providers
- **Referential Integrity** - Comprehensive foreign key constraints
- **Data Validation** - CHECK constraints and business rule enforcement
- **Audit Trail** - Complete system activity logging with JSON structured data
- **Performance Optimization** - Strategic indexing for common queries
- **Security Rules** - Triggers preventing data corruption and unauthorized changes
- **Scalability** - Designed to handle high transaction volumes

### Database Features

- **Generated Columns** - Automatic net amount calculation
- **JSON Support** - Flexible structured data storage in logs
- **Stored Procedures** - Reusable business logic for fee calculations
- **Views** - Optimized queries for common reporting needs
- **Security Triggers** - Automatic audit logging and data protection
- **Comprehensive Indexing** - Performance optimization for all query patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Database Technology Stack

- **Database:** MySQL 8.0+
- **Features Used:**
  - Generated columns for automatic calculations
  - JSON data type for flexible structured storage
  - Advanced indexing strategies
  - Stored procedures for business logic
  - Security triggers for data protection
  - Comprehensive constraint enforcement

### Data Integrity & Security

- **Constraint Validation:** Amount validation, currency checks, balance consistency
- **Referential Integrity:** Proper foreign key relationships with cascade rules
- **Audit Compliance:** Immutable completed transactions, automatic change logging
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions for different system components
- **Data Protection:** Triggers preventing unauthorized deletions and modifications

### Performance Optimizations

- **Strategic Indexing:** Composite indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Query Optimization:** Efficient joins and filtering strategies
- **View Materialization:** Pre-computed common query results
- **Scalability Considerations:** Partitioning strategy for large data volumes

## Getting Started

### Database Setup

1. Install MySQL 8.0 or higher
2. Run the database setup script:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p < database/database_setup.sql
   ```
3. The script will create the complete database schema with sample data

### Project Structure

- Review the comprehensive database design document in `docs/database_design_document.md`
- Explore JSON data models and API examples in `examples/json_schemas.json`
- Execute sample queries to understand the data relationships

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Development

- Frontend interface development
- SMS processing engine implementation
- API development for data access
- Real-time analytics dashboard
- Mobile application interface
