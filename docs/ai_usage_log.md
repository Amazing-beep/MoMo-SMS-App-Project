### Prohibited AI Uses (Not Used)

The following AI uses are explicitly prohibited for this assignment and were NOT used:

❌ **ERD Design Generation** - All entity relationships and database schema designed independently by team members  
❌ **SQL Schema Creation** - Database structure and table definitions created through team collaboration  
❌ **Business Logic Generation** - Transaction processing rules and fee calculations developed from business requirements analysis  
❌ **Technical Explanations Writing** - All design rationale and documentation written by team members  

### Human-Authored Components

All core assignment components were created through human analysis and design:

1. **Entity Relationship Design** - Team brainstorming sessions identified 8 core entities based on MoMo business requirements
2. **Database Schema** - Table structures designed through iterative team discussions
3. **JSON Data Models** - API response structures based on frontend requirements analysis
4. **Business Rules** - Fee calculations and validation rules derived from Uganda mobile money industry research
5. **Sample Data** - Realistic test data created using knowledge of Ugandan naming conventions and phone number formats
6. **Documentation** - All explanations and justifications written from team understanding of database principles

### Team Collaboration Evidence

- **Individual Contributions:** Each team member focused on specific entities (Amazing: Users & Transactions, Tito: Providers & Categories, Kevine: Logs & Security)
- **Design Discussions:** Weekly team meetings documented entity relationships and business rules
- **Code Reviews:** Peer review process for SQL syntax and constraint definitions
- **Testing Approach:** Collaborative development of sample queries and test scenarios

### Academic Integrity Statement

We certify that all core design decisions, business logic, database relationships, and technical implementations were developed through human analysis and team collaboration. AI tools were used only for permitted purposes (grammar checking, syntax verification, and research citation) as documented above.

The database design reflects our team's understanding of:
- Mobile money transaction processing requirements
- Database normalization principles
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security and audit compliance needs
